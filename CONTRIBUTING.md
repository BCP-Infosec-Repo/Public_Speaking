# Contributing

Hello! Thank you for being interested in contributing to this repository! We're grateful for our contributors.

There are many ways to contribute to this repository:

## Submit a link

This is the most common form of contribution. You have found a public speaking resource which is not yet represented in the repo and you wish to add it. Thank you!

We follow the standard GitHub [pull request process](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/). Please send a pull request (aka PR) with your contribution. We will then review it and either merge directly or ask you for modifications before merging.

Once in a great while we'll have to close the PR without merging it. This typically happens when the PR submits duplicate information or information which is not really applicable to this repo.

If you have problems with the [pull request process](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) (for instance if you are new to GitHub), please join us in the `#public_speaking` channel on Freenode IRC and ask for assistance.

Not familiar with IRC? No problem! [Click here for a web interface](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=%23public_speaking). Just select a nickname and then you're good to chat!

## Open an issue

Have a question? Want someone else to add a resource for you? Just want to bounce something off the community? Great!

Opening an issue is a valuable form of contribution. Just [fill in the New Issue form](https://github.com/vmbrasseur/Public_Speaking/issues/new).

When you open your issue, try to make it as specific and as actionable as possible. Open-ended issues are difficult to resolve and may be closed.
